The earth formed about  billion years ago and within half

billion years the first life originated Everything alive today is

descended from those first simple life forms In the tree of life

some groups of living things branched out along different paths long

ago and now have little in common while others have branched only

recently and are still very similar In other words some living

things are close relatives while others are distant cousins or near

total strangers It isn't always easy to see that family history

because we can only look at species that are alive today the living

buds at the tips of the branches while the rest of the tree is

hidden in the past Sometimes fossil of an extinct species provides

clue but fossils are rare and finding them requires hard work and

lot of luck The science of Taxonomy uses the similarities and

differences between organisms as clues to try to figure out the

puzzle of relationships

The following are all made of steel and are all found in the

toolbox We will assume they are all living things derived from a

common ancestor Let's decide who is most closely related and who is

more distantly related

 structures  structures which are similar because of

common ancestry Example  the front appendages of vertebrates are

homologous The flipper of whale the wing of bat the paw of a

cat the arm of human and the wing of bird all have the same

internal bone structure with only slight modifications in shape and

size  they each contain humerus radius an ulncarpals

metacarpals and phalanges

 structures  structures which perform similar functions

but are based on completely independent designs Example  the wing

of an insect is analagous to the wing of bird or the wing of an

airplane

  the process by which distantly related organisms

come to resemble each other closely because they are adapting to the

same environment and are under similar selection pressures Example

the streamlined body and fins of dolphins and seals both mammals

resemble those of fishes because swimming well requires these

modifications

  sharedderived trait Synapomorphys are traits

not found in the ancestors but which are shared by group of

descendants Species which have sharedderived characteristics are

probably closely related because the same structure rarely evolves

more than once in separate lineages
==========
There appear to be four major groups  the bolts the nuts the

screws and the nails The group that is most different from the

others is the nuts because all the others are long and have head

Within the three remaining groups the nails are the most different

because both the screws and bolts are threaded Finally the screws

and bolts can be divided based on the pointed tips of the screws

Someone might argue that the nails and screws have more in common

because they both have pointed tip and that pointy tip is more

important trait than threading This is good argument See if a

third trait lends support for grouping them based on either the

threading or the pointy tips

Within each of the major groups the branching continues Bolts

and  could be grouped as closest relatives because  and  have

identical heads and bolt diameters Or you might argue that Bolts

and  are more closely related because they are the same length while

Bolt  is longer In the dichotomous splitting into twos tree of

relationships shown below it was decided that  and  were closer

because head shape and bolt diameter are two traits that are shared

between  and  while length is the only trait shared between  and

 Note that the position of  and  could be switched with that of

 without changing the meaning of the tree   and  are all

equally distant from the pair of screws  and

A key is useful when you find an organism and you want to identify

it based on its characteristics Here is key based on the tree for

the nuts and bolts Start at Question and read the description If

the answer to is Yes you would be sent to Question If the

answer to Question is No you go to Question which then

sends you to Question  Keep following the directions until you know

the species by its identifying number

Rounded head

Not rounded head

Flat head

Go to Question

Not flat head

Body length twice the width of head

Body length not twice the width of head

The identifying numbers have been removed from the nuts and bolts

in the following picture Use the key to identify them and write the

correct species number in the blank next to each one

 Carefully examine the imaginary animals

or plants

In both cases these imaginary organisms represent separate species

that are descended from common ancestor Some have remained much

like the ancestral species while others have adapted to different

environments and have changed to better suit their new lifestyles

However you will still see physical features in these species which

indicate their relationship to each other You must use those clues

to determine who is most closely related to whom

 Cut out the creatures so that their identifying numbers remain

with them On large surface do some initial sorting of the

creatures so you can compare them for similarities and differences

Try arranging them several different ways before you decide When you

think you have figured out the major groupings get blank piece of

paper and draw rough draft of your dichotomously branching tree

splitting from one branch into two based on the similarities and

differences between the organisms Refer to the nuts and bolts tree

as an example The first branch of the tree should divide the

organisms along the most distinctive lines and subsequent branches

should separate organisms based upon more and more subtle

differences Each time the tree splits always from one branch into

only two write down the distinguishing characteristic you used

Choose your distinguishing characters so that they are unambiguous

Example If you say Big eye vs little eye you may run into

problems Big as compared to what? However if you said Eye bigger

than mouth then you can look at the mouth and decide

 When your tree is complete and the creatures are all separated

from each other no further divisions are possible glue all of the

individuals down along the top of new piece of paper according to

your tree of groups and subgroups Then redraw the branches of your

relationship tree as in the nuts and bolts example

 Create dichotomous key to the organisms using the example
