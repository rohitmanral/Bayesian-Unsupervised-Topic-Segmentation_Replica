==========
Perform the following simple experiments to  your sensory system

 Some of these experiments work best with a partner

 Write a brief report which describes your experiences and answers the questions below

 you will learn there are many more  than the traditional five and there is also a lot of interaction between them

 The  is a thin layer of neural tissue lining the back inside of the eyeball this tissue contains the receptors for vision that are called  and 

 Cones are color sensitive and work best in bright light

 Rods are more light sensitive and work better in dim light but are not sensitive to color so they are important to night vision

 Cones are most densely concentrated in the center of the retina while rods are more concentrated around the periphery of the retina

 Sit in the dark for a few minutes to let your eyes adjust

 near darkness stare directly at an object and attempt to make out the details

 Now look at it using your peripheral vision (from the side)

 Can you make it out more clearly? How does this relate to rods and cones? Try this trick while stargazing and you'll see more!   Lay several colored objects in front of you and very slowly bring up the lights from full darkness

 Why can you see but not easily identify colors in dim light? How does this relate to rods and cones?

The retina is like a projection screen on which the image is focused by the lens of your eye

 Within the retina however there is a small area where the optic nerve connects to the eye this area is called the papilla

 There are no light sensitive cells in this area which is called the 

 visual information is sent to the brain from the part of your field of vision projected onto the papilla

 One interesting bit of trivia is that the  (found in the invertebrate molluscs like octopus and squid) evolved independently from the vertebrate eye and because of a different internal design lacks a blind spot

 Hold your left hand over your left eye while staring directly at the upper X with your right eye and  approach the screen until the black spot disappears (about a foot away from the screen)

 You have found your blind spot

 Now repeat this procedure while looking at the X in the lower panel

you have trouble finding your blind spot remember to move your head very slowly towards the screen with your left eye covered

 A change in sensitivity limited to a restricted region of the retina is called local adaptation

 This can result in the production of afterimages

With one eye covered fixate on the white dot in the center of the peace symbol on the left for about seconds

 Then fixate on the black dot in the middle of the circle to the right

 Describe what you see in the white circle

Compensation a blind person's sense of hearing or smell enhanced or is a blind person just doing more with the same information than a sighted person does?

 some cases as with the blind spot experiment the brain fills in missing information to compensate for the missing data coming from the blind spot region but it can only fill in a regular pattern by sampling the area around the missing data

 other cases perception (which occurs in the brain) can be fooled by what the eye sees accurately

 each of these  try to identify why your perception is being fooled

 Note in the figure of the eye above that the image that comes to the eye is projected upside down onto the retina

     Due to a mutation on the X chromosome males are more likely to express  than females since females (who are Xhave a backup X and males (who are Xdon't

 About of males have some degree of red-green color blindness

  the following test chart everyone can easily distinguish the orange circle but people with red-green colorblindness will have difficulty identifying the red star

 vision means that at a distance of feet you can distinguish the letters on a chart as well as the average person can at feet

 A person with vision is very nearsighted because what they can only see at feet an average person can see at feet

 A person with vision has better than average visual acuity because they can see at feet what the average person can only see at Sometimes these acuity ratios are divided through to give a single number

The earth formed about  billion years ago and within half

billion years the first life originated Everything alive today is

descended from those first simple life forms In the tree of life

some groups of living things branched out along different paths long

ago and now have little in common while others have branched only

recently and are still very similar In other words some living

things are close relatives while others are distant cousins or near

total strangers It isn't always easy to see that family history

because we can only look at species that are alive today the living

buds at the tips of the branches while the rest of the tree is

hidden in the past Sometimes fossil of an extinct species provides

clue but fossils are rare and finding them requires hard work and

lot of luck The science of Taxonomy uses the similarities and

differences between organisms as clues to try to figure out the

puzzle of relationships

The following are all made of steel and are all found in the

toolbox We will assume they are all living things derived from a

common ancestor Let's decide who is most closely related and who is

more distantly related

 structures  structures which are similar because of

common ancestry Example  the front appendages of vertebrates are

homologous The flipper of whale the wing of bat the paw of a

cat the arm of human and the wing of bird all have the same

internal bone structure with only slight modifications in shape and

size  they each contain humerus radius an ulncarpals

metacarpals and phalanges

 structures  structures which perform similar functions

but are based on completely independent designs Example  the wing

of an insect is analagous to the wing of bird or the wing of an

airplane

  the process by which distantly related organisms

come to resemble each other closely because they are adapting to the

same environment and are under similar selection pressures Example

the streamlined body and fins of dolphins and seals both mammals

resemble those of fishes because swimming well requires these

modifications

  sharedderived trait Synapomorphys are traits

not found in the ancestors but which are shared by group of

descendants Species which have sharedderived characteristics are

probably closely related because the same structure rarely evolves

more than once in separate lineages

 that case a number greater than  means above average visual acuity while a  is average and a number less than  indicates below average visual acuity

Receptors for taste and smell are called chemoreceptors

 The taste buds which are distributed all over the tongue can detect five quite distinct taste sensations sweet sour salty  (savory) and bitter

 However the  of foods is also strongly influenced by the sense of smell

 The mouth cavity is open to the nasal cavity so molecules can diffuse from the mouth up to the odor receptors in the nose

 Have you noticed that when you have a head cold things often don't taste quite right? That's because your nasal sinuses are blocked

 Perform the following experiment to determine how your sense of taste is affected by smell

Unwrap two hard candies with very different flavors (butterscotch and mint for example) and place them in front of you

Pinch your nose and close your eyes so you can't tell which candy you'll be tasting

Place a candy on your tongue

 Let it remain there for a few seconds

Take that candy off your tongue and guess which flavor it is

Rinse with water between tastes

Try again with the second candy

Repeat with your eyes still closed but this time don't pinch your nose

Have you noticed that when you first enter a room you may smell something strongly but after a few minutes in the room you no longer notice the smell or find it much less intense? This is called satiation

 It's not that the scent has faded but that your receptors are all blocked by the scent molecules and are no longer sending the signal to your brain

 someone new enters the room they may comment on the scent that you detected before but no longer notice

Soak a tissue with perfume and have the subject take a good sniff and remain near the soaked tissue for -minutes of exposure

 Have the subject describe the smell again after the exposure

  Send the subject out of the room for a few minutes for some fresh air

 When they come back ask them to describe the smell again and compare it to their first exposure

  It's not that the smell has dissipated but that the receptors have cleared while the subject got some fresh air

You have numerous specialized sensors in your skin know as mechanoreceptors

 Some respond to pressure touch (tactile sense) pain hot and cold

 However these receptors are at different densities in different locations on your body

 The distance between two tactile stimuli at which the two are just discerned to be separate is known as the simultaneous spatial threshold

Unbend a paper clip and re-bend it so the two tips are close together

 Measure the distance

While your partner closes his or her eyes place the two tips of the paper clips simultaneously on the back of his/her arm

 Ask your partner if he or she feels two tips or one
==========
There appear to be four major groups  the bolts the nuts the

screws and the nails The group that is most different from the

others is the nuts because all the others are long and have head

Within the three remaining groups the nails are the most different

because both the screws and bolts are threaded Finally the screws

and bolts can be divided based on the pointed tips of the screws

Someone might argue that the nails and screws have more in common

because they both have pointed tip and that pointy tip is more

important trait than threading This is good argument See if a

third trait lends support for grouping them based on either the

threading or the pointy tips

Within each of the major groups the branching continues Bolts

and  could be grouped as closest relatives because  and  have

identical heads and bolt diameters Or you might argue that Bolts

and  are more closely related because they are the same length while

Bolt  is longer In the dichotomous splitting into twos tree of

relationships shown below it was decided that  and  were closer

because head shape and bolt diameter are two traits that are shared

between  and  while length is the only trait shared between  and

 Note that the position of  and  could be switched with that of

 without changing the meaning of the tree   and  are all

equally distant from the pair of screws  and

A key is useful when you find an organism and you want to identify

it based on its characteristics Here is key based on the tree for

the nuts and bolts Start at Question and read the description If

Change the distance between the two tips

 Every now and then touch them with just one tip to be sure they aren't just guessing two all the time

doing this procedure repeatedly you should be able to get a good estimate of the simultaneous spatial threshold of the back of the arm

 Measure this distance with a ruler

Repeat using the back of the hand and the palm of the hand and compare results

 Which of the three areas is the most sensitive? Which is the least?

What distances did you measure for each area? Why do you think that these distances vary so much?What parts of the body might have the smallest spatial threshold?What parts have the largest spatial threshold? 

 Have you ever noticed that when you first get into a bathtub of hot water you can barely tolerate it and only a few minutes later it seems fine? The sensation of temperature is not absolute - the sensation is eventually reduced

 demonstrate this phenomenon prepare three basins of water one with hot water one with lukewarm water and one with ice water

Have the subject place one hand in hot water and the other hand in ice water

 After at least  minute of immersion have your partner place one hand in the lukewarm water and describe the temperature

 Then have them place the other hand in the same basin and again describe the temperature

Why is it that although both hands experience the same temperature the sensation differs?

    The sense of  depends upon the vibration of sound waves on the thin membrane called the tympanum or eardrum which in turn vibrates in turn each of the  bones of the middle ear the malleus incus and stapes commonly called hammer anvil and stirrup

 The last bone activates tiny hairs which send a nervous impulse to the brain

 First have a blindfolded subject try to point to a ticking object like a clock or a kitchen timer while their head is in a fixed position

 Then allow them to turn their head while trying to identify the source of the sound

 Which is more effective - turning the head or staying still? Why? Why is it harder with an earplug in one ear? How do animals that can turn their ears have a further advantage?

 Balance or equilibrium is controlled by the semicircular canals of the inner ear

 Each of the three canals is oriented along one of the  dimensions of the body (the x y and z axes) so motion in any direction is felt when the fluid inside the canals triggers tiny hairs on the inside

 The brain integrates this information into a sense of balance

 Have a person stand on both feet without moving while their eyes are closed

 Then have them balance on one foot with their eyes closed

 Finally have them walk a straight line with their eyes closed

 How does vision work in concert with the sense of balance? Can you see why people are asked to walk a straight line to test sobriety?

 How is it that even with your eyes closed you know whether your arms are extended directly in front of you up over your head or down at your side bent at the elbow or straight with palms facing up or down? you think this is affected by gravity or not? Would an astronaut in zero gravity and in pitch darkness know? Can you touch your nose with your eyes closed?

  Motion sickness is generally caused when the inner ear and the eye disagree about the status of the body

 For example when you are in a smooth riding car and you look out the window your eye tells you that you are moving rapidly while your inner ear says you are sitting still

 a way both are true but the brain can't rationalize these two different experiences and it results in nausea for some people

 Why does staring at a fixed point on the horizon rather than the fast moving terrain sometimes help to reduce motion sickness? Why is zero gravity nausea inducing for most people?

Near a busy street or highway where cars are moving at a steady speed close your eyes and listen as cars approach pass you and then move away

 The sound of the car will have a higher pitch as it is approaching and as it passes and moves away the pitch should drop

 This happens because the sound waves are closer together on approach because the car is chasing its own sound waves

 The faster the vehicle is moving the more pronounced this effect will be

 After the car passes the sound waves are farther apart because the car is retreating from its sound waves

 When a vehicle moves fast enough (the speed of sound is mph) to catch up to its own sound waves a sonic boom occurs because the sound waves produced earlier are added to the ones produced now

Other Animals Describe a sense that we have which is more keenly developed in another animal

 For example the bloodhound's sense of smell or the cat's night vision

 Describe a sense that another animal has which we lack entirely

The identifying numbers have been removed from the nuts and bolts

in the following picture Use the key to identify them and write the

correct species number in the blank next to each one

 Carefully examine the imaginary animals

or plants

In both cases these imaginary organisms represent separate species

that are descended from common ancestor Some have remained much

like the ancestral species while others have adapted to different

environments and have changed to better suit their new lifestyles

However you will still see physical features in these species which

indicate their relationship to each other You must use those clues

to determine who is most closely related to whom

 Cut out the creatures so that their identifying numbers remain

with them On large surface do some initial sorting of the

creatures so you can compare them for similarities and differences

Try arranging them several different ways before you decide When you

think you have figured out the major groupings get blank piece of

paper and draw rough draft of your dichotomously branching tree

splitting from one branch into two based on the similarities and

differences between the organisms Refer to the nuts and bolts tree

as an example The first branch of the tree should divide the

organisms along the most distinctive lines and subsequent branches

should separate organisms based upon more and more subtle

differences Each time the tree splits always from one branch into

only two write down the distinguishing characteristic you used

Choose your distinguishing characters so that they are unambiguous

Example If you say Big eye vs little eye you may run into

problems Big as compared to what? However if you said Eye bigger

than mouth then you can look at the mouth and decide

 When your tree is complete and the creatures are all separated

from each other no further divisions are possible glue all of the

individuals down along the top of new piece of paper according to

your tree of groups and subgroups Then redraw the branches of your

relationship tree as in the nuts and bolts example

 Create dichotomous key to the organisms using the example
